## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Using multiple background images is not ideal.

### Continued development

I still need to learn more about how to make the background look like the original design, I think I'll revise this code once I learn a bit more about background image positioning.
